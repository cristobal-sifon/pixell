Libsharp
--------

`Libsharp` is an important dependency for the curved sky tools in `effsky`. The installation script will attempt to automatically git clone the latest version and compile it. If you want to use your own existing `Libsharp` installation, you should symlink that directory into `_deps/`, such that e.g. `_deps/libsharp/libsharp/sharp.h` exists.
